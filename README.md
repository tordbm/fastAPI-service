# FastAPI backend
This backend is deployed to <a href="https://koyeb.com">koyeb.com</a> and (for now) only serves my weather application. It implements several key features including endpoints for user creation, login, fetching user info, saving a users favorite cities and more. Developing proper tests for the project is a work in progress but it will be implemented.
